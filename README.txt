SimplexJS
A linear and mixed-integer linear programming solver written in Javascript.

UPDATE September 2014:
This code was written a long time ago, "just for fun". I do not recommend using it for production work. It doesn't follow any particular Javascript coding style, and probably has bugs. It also, up until this time, didn't have a license. From this point on, consider it under the MIT License.
